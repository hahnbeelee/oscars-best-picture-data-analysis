# oscars-best-picture-data-analysis
## Description
This is a data science project I conducted for the final project for the class INFO 2950 (Introduction to Data Science) @ Cornell University.
All of the main findings can be found in [final-report-hahnbee-lee.ipynb](https://github.com/hahnbeelee/oscars-best-picture-data-analysis/blob/master/final-report-hahnbee-lee.ipynb).
### Introduction
On social media, I've been seeing more and more posts about how the Academy Awards (commonly known as the Oscars) are becoming "political" which I've interpreted to mean that the movies that win don't align with the general public's opinion. Therefore, in order to test whether this is actually true I wanted to analyze the Oscar's Best Picture nominee and winner data and their IMDB scores and gross. I specifically chose the Best Picture category because it is considered the most prestigious award of the ceremony, receives the most attention, and is the award that chooses its winner based on the whole movie (and not a single aspect of it).
### Research Questions
In order to compare the general public's reaction to a movie vs. what the Academy thinks is Best Picture winner worthy, I decided to observe the IMDB scores and gross of best picture nominees Overarching Question:

- Does the best picture winner align with the movie's actual popularity?
- What is the trend of IMDB scores for the movies that won the Best Picture award throughout the years?
- How do the IMDB scores of the movies that won Best Picture compare to the nominees in the same year?
- How do the gross of the Best Picture winner compare to the highest grossing movie of the same year?
### Main Findings
There is no correlation between IMDB scores of best picture winners vs. the year the movie was nominated best picture. Nor is there a trend of the highest IMDB score between all the nominees in a given year throughout the years. However, 47.7% of the best picture winners had the highest IMDB score in comparison to its nominees. And only 11.4% of best picture winners were the highest grossing movie of its given year. The percentages show why people may feel like the Oscars are becoming more political (the existence of higher rated/grossing movies), but the claim that they are increasingly becoming more political is false (because of the lack of a trend).
